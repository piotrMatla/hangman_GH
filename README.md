## Project status
The Hangman Game is a fully functional project, but there may be updates and improvements in the future. One of them is the choice of game language. Another of the planned changes is the enlargement of the word bank.

## Graphics 
The graphics for the game were `created by the game's author` using the ***Adobe Illustrator*** graphics program. It was created in isometric style to give a nice look to the game. This makes it friendly for younger users.

The player starts having 9 lives (like a cat) and with each successive mistake he loses a life and more gallows elements begin to appear on the board.

When he loses the last life the whole graphic becomes gray except for the "Hang Man" sign. This is to emphasize the lost state of the game.
